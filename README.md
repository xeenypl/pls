# pls
Minimalistic sudo/doas replacement.

# How to use:
- Create groupe `pls`.
- Run `make install` (as a root)
- Add your user to groupe `pls`(you may need to restat your system after this).
- And you ready to go

# Why?
I was watching a [Brodie Robertson video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7abih61ht-I)
and then I thought, I can do better than that.

# Why it's can be actualy uesful.
- As Brodie said is not popular softwere no one knows about it.
- Depends on pretty match nothing (only libc, and crypt).
- Has no confing file (like suckless tools).
- Is more suckless.
- Is more uinx (do one thing and do it very well).
