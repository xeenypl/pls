# pls
Minimalistic sudo/doas replacement.

# How to use:
Run `install.sh` (as a root) add your user to groupe `pls` and you ready to go
(you may need to restat your system).

# Why?
I was watching a [Brodie Robertson video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7abih61ht-I)
and then I thought, I can do better than that.

# Why it's can be actualy uesful.
- As Brodie said is not popular softwere no one knows about it.
- Depends on pretty match nothing (only libc, and crypt).
- Has no confing file (like suckless tools).
- Is more suckless.
- Is mote uinx (do one thing and do it very well).
